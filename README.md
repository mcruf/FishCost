# FishCost

This repository contains all necessary code to conduct a cost-effective analysis of commercial fisheries (fishery-dependent) and scientific survey (fishery-independent) data.

It is based on the paper [Getting more for less: benchmarking the cost-effectiveness of fishery-dependent and  -independent monitoring programs](https://www.google.com).
